# Python-for-Pentesters
This Github repository is dedicated to helping new/aspiring Pentesters utilize Python for their security needs. It includes scripts, cheatsheets, and tutorials on how to use Python for pentesting purposes aslo resources to learn from. Learn how to use Python for enumeration, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation.The repository also covers more advanced topics such as creating custom tools, developing exploits, and writing custom payloads. Whatever your Python pentesting needs, this repository has you covered.

𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐬:
First you shoul know the very basic of Python, how python is different from other programming langugaes, why you should choose python for as your scripting language and blah blah...
- Well I'm certainly not going to copy paste youtube links teahing python for general/developement use. So I'm assuming you are alredy familiar with basic of python (variables, operators, strings, lists, tuples, loops, dictionaries, file I/O, functions, OOP, pip installer, sockets, debugging, modules, and exception handling.)

Enough of the Youtube videos --

First we will start with some basic tasks -
